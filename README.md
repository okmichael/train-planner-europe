# train-planner-europe
A public dataset / basic server for railroad planning in Europe

I'll write more about this public project later on.
For now that's just it, just trying to find my way :)

This is my first github project. I have used git before on a private project with git on a private server.

Here I'll make public some harder stuff, I encountered will developing the train planning module on http://www.eurotripplanner.eu/
